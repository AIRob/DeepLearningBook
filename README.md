# DeepLearningBook
This repository is used to publish source code of my deep learning book 

## Requirements
To run the code, you should
 - Anaconda2. Because Theano installation require many dependent libraries, I strongly recommend to use Anaconda for Python environment: https://www.continuum.io/downloads/
 - Theano 0.8 or higher. please follow official instruction to install: http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html
 - pre-trained word2vec vectors. you can download Google New from https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/
 - dataset. we use different datasets for this book, I will show url in the following parts. 
 - Hardware.
